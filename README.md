# firmware

A Marlin 2.0.9.6 firmware I made for the Ender 3 Max printer with STM32F103RE Creality 4.2.2(512K) board. 

This firmware supports Host Actions options and M73 reporting. 

This is a test to see if this firmware will allow for stopping and starting prints through Octoprint, and to see if it will display print status on the LCD when printing a model from the web interface of Octoprint.

More updates to come :)

To Do: Build the firmware for the 2.1.x bugfix release of Marlin

5/26/23:
    
   Was looking through advanced config file and stumbled across some games. The new bin file Ender3Max4.2.2Games is the same firmware just with the games added in. 
     
   Games will be found under About menu option.
    
   *As far as I know the games will only work with printers that have a non-touch screen with a knob. Have not had the chance to test just yet if this will work with touch screen printers. Stay tuned!*
