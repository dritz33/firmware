# firmware

A Marlin 2.0.9.6 firmware I made for the Ender 3 Max printer with STM32F103RE Creality 4.2.2(512K) board. 

This firmware supports Host Actions options and M73 reporting. 

This is a test to see if this firmware will allow for stopping and starting prints through Octoprint, and to see if it will display print status on the LCD when printing a model from the web interface of Octoprint.
